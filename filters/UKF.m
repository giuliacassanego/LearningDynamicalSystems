% Robust UKF

% Input:
%       f/h: Model
%       x_0: Initial condition x(1|0)
%       P0 : Initial condition variance P(1|0)
%       B  : Matrix B of the noise inputs
%       D  : Matrix D of the noise inputs
%       y  : Measured data
%       len: Length of the dataset, and so the length of the iterations

% Outputs:
%       x_pred: state predcited   x(t+1|t)
%       P_pred: state performance P(t+1|t)
